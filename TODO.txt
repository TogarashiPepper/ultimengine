optimizations to be made:
look at optimizing score_game
PGO / BOLT
Late Move Reduction
More Efficient Board Representation (similar to bitboards perhaps)
Making legal_moves an iterator to save on allocations
Better search function(?)

look into if self-play SPRT could help replace benchmark.rs
Ensure score_game is symmetric
make alpha_beta branchless
